What I find interesting about the article is how it touches on the different important aspects of programming and software engineering that are often glossed over or neglected in education. The article reinforces the importance of various programming practices that a developer needs to uphold, which is useful for all new software engineers.

### Response from Paula S.

This is an interesting analysis considering how much disparity and variance in knowledge and skills exists through the software field. It is a relatively new area with endless possibilities, but it evolved so fast it's almost like we didn't have time to create a proper, widely adopted structure for teaching it. However, it is refreshing to partake in a field with such diversity in ideas, motives, and interpretations of complex topics. Perhaps in the future when we understand both machines and the human mind better, we will develop an adequate system for mastering the intricacies of this role.
